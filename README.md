E-Commerce API
The E-Commerce API is a RESTful web service that allows users to manage users, items, and orders for an e-commerce platform.

Technologies Used
Python
Flask
Flask SQLAlchemy


Description:
The API allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users and items in the e-commerce system. Users can place orders for items, and you can retrieve information about users, items, and their respective orders.

Endpoints:

GET /users: Retrieves a list of all users along with their associated orders.
GET /users/<user_id>: Retrieves detailed information about a specific user, including their name, email, and orders.
GET /items: Retrieves a list of all available items.
GET /items/<item_id>: Retrieves detailed information about a specific item.
POST /items: Creates a new item. Provide the item details in the request body as JSON.
PUT /items/<item_id>: Updates an existing item. Provide the updated item details in the request body as JSON.
DELETE /items/<item_id>: Deletes an existing item.
Usage Instructions:

Ensure you have Python and the necessary dependencies installed (Flask, SQLAlchemy, Faker).
Run the app.py file.
Once the server is running, you can send HTTP requests to the specified endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or a web browser.
